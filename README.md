I found myself rewriting the same code each time I wanted to start a new project so I built this repo for everyone to use. If you find this starter useful don't hesitate to let me know with a star it's always nice to know your work is appreciated âœ¨
<br /><br />

## For the builders
Feel free to fork or clone this repo for your own use. Don't forget to remove the dummy code before building you own thing of course.
<br /><br />

## For the learners
I'm writting a full step-by-step guide for those of you who'd like to learn who to build such an API. I'll publish it on Medium when it's ready so stay tuned.
<br /><br />
